      This document is the foundation of our values and code of conduct, designed to guide each member of our military
      simulation team. It defines the fundamental principles that ensure our cohesion, our operational effectiveness,
      and mutual respect within our community. By adhering to these guidelines, together we build a challenging,
      high-performing, and inclusive gaming environment.

          Every man is torn between two needs. The need for the Canoe, that is, for the journey, for breaking away from
          oneself, and the need for the Tree, that is, for rooting, for identity. Men constantly wander between these
          two needs, giving in sometimes to one, sometimes to the other, until the day they understand that it is with
          the Tree that the Canoe is made.

    <p class="m-5">
      For our team to be strong and successful, it is imperative that each member feels safe, respected, and valued. We
      are committed to creating and maintaining an environment where kindness, inclusiveness and mutual respect are the
      foundations of all our interactions, both during and off-site operations. Concretely, this translates into the
      following commitments: </p>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        No leniency on harmful behavior
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        We reject any form of harassment, discrimination (based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, political
        opinions, or any other personal characteristic), hate speech, bullying, or any toxic attitude that could harm
        others or undermine the cohesion of the group. Jokes in poor taste, stereotypes, or degrading remarks are
        strictly prohibited;
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Being respectful, attentive, and constructive
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        We expect everyone to converse actively and respectfully, even in cases of disagreement. Any criticism must be
        formulated constructively, targeting actions and not the individual, with the aim of helping the players and the
        team progress; </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Confidentiality and respect for privacy
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Information and discussions shared within the team, especially those of a personal nature, are considered
        confidential. We are committed to respecting everyone's privacy and never disclose personal information outside
        or even within the team;
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        A safe space to learn and grow
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        We foster an environment where it is permissible to ask questions, express doubts, or make mistakes without fear
        of judgment, ridicule, or excessive reprimand. Mistakes are seen as an opportunity for learning and growth,
        beneficial to both the individual and the entire team.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="m-5">
      If a member witnesses or is the victim of behavior that violates these principles, it is imperative and encouraged
      to report it without hesitation to the team's management or those in charge of the mission. Every report will be
      taken seriously, handled with the utmost fairness, and appropriate measures will be implemented to ensure the
      safety and integrity of our collective environment. Our priority is to protect and support all team members.

        ⚠️ Important note about violent content
      </h4>
      <div class="m-3">
        This community is built around a video game rated PEGI 16, due to the presence of "violence and strong
        language." Therefore, our community is appropriately moderated for people aged 16 and over. This does not mean
        that it is inappropriate for younger people, but that content that may offend them may be shared. If you are
        concerned about the possibility that you or your children may be exposed to such content, we encourage you to
        move away from it or take steps to prevent your children from accessing it.

    <h3 class="p-3 rounded bg-light-subtle border border-light-subtle">
      3. Assignment based on merit
    </h3>

    <p class="m-5">
      Within our team, the assignment of responsibilities and tactical roles during operations is based on an objective
      assessment. Command or specialized opportunities and functions are assigned to members who demonstrate the
      greatest competence, reliability, and efficiency, for the sole benefit of the collective objective. This
      guarantees optimal performance and places real capability first.
    </p>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Proven competence
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Our model is based on concrete and measurable criteria, not on seniority or affinities. This
        approach relies on qualifications based on known and transparent criteria. They allow players to
        demonstrate their aptitude and operational effectiveness in real-life conditions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        A transparent and accessible qualifications system
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        To ensure objectivity, we have a clear assessment system. Training content is freely accessible, and trainers
        are available during regular sessions or on demand. Assessment sessions allow players to obtain temporary
        qualifications, certifying actual aptitude and encouraging continuous skills updating.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Role assignment and progression
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Key roles are assigned as a priority or exclusively to players with up-to-date qualifications demonstrating
        their aptitude. Constructive feedback and continuous improvement are essential, with feedback provided after
        each operation or assessment to encourage self-improvement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="m-5">
      By adhering to this approach, we ensure that our team is always led and composed of the
      most appropriate skills, promoting efficiency, performance, and a fair playing environment for all.
    </p>

    <h3 class="p-3 rounded bg-light-subtle border border-light-subtle">
      4. An ambitious and collective approach
    </h3>

    <p class="m-5">
      The objective is to create a serious, efficient, and cooperative gaming environment. We want to give ourselves the
      means to carry out large-scale operations (platoon or company level), structured and effective. To achieve this
      ambition, we rely on three fundamental principles that guide our operations and our collective progress:
      immersion, cooperation, and self-improvement. These principles are translated concretely into our operations as
      follows:
    </p>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Punctuality
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Punctuality reflects our mutual respect and our commitment to the team. Each minute of delay can disrupt
        briefings and preparations. We expect exemplarity from each member: all missions and training sessions begin
        at the agreed time and do not wait for latecomers. Team members plan ahead and ensure they receive their
        briefings on time. In the event of an unforeseen impediment, it is imperative to inform the team as soon as
        possible to limit the impact.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Cooperation

      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        The leadership ensures that each player is assigned to a unit with a clear and functional hierarchy and that
        instructions are complete, clear, and accessible before operations begin. In return, everyone must understand
        and accept their role within the unit. It is their responsibility to read and understand all necessary
        instructions before acting, and to ask for clarifications if necessary. Lone players are not compatible with our
        objectives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Communications Hygiene
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Communications discipline is fundamental to our effectiveness. Communication is clear, concise, and relevant to
        the mission, using simulated communication tools. Personal or off-topic discussions are set aside during action
        phases. We operate as a cohesive unit, following the directions of the designated mission commander.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        No Respawn
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        A crucial aspect of our immersion is the total absence of a respawn mechanism in our story-driven missions. This
        rule deeply anchors the experience in heightened tactical realism, while remaining a space for experimentation
        where error is accepted. Each action then takes on capital importance: every maneuver and decision is weighed,
        knowing that an error will have a direct impact on the course of the operation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Limitations to Roleplaying
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Regarding roleplaying, our approach is simple. We do not expect our members to play fictional characters. We do
        not use any fictitious military rank system within the team, out of respect for real military personnel and
        their duties. Consequently, each member is treated with respect, regardless of their role or function. The same
        respect is due to team members, members of other teams, and visitors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Limitations to Simulation
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Most features and tools that could break immersion (such as third-person view or external visual aids) are
        technically disabled on our servers. If, for technical reasons, a meta feature cannot be disabled, its use by a
        player remains strictly prohibited and would be considered a violation of our principles. We rely on each member
        to fully concentrate on the simulated gaming environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        After-Action Evaluation
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Any analysis or criticism of the orders given is shared during the mandatory debriefing following the operation.
        Each player commits to participating, with a desire to learn from their experiences, adapt to unexpected
        challenges, and master new skills. The team supports this approach by fostering a safe environment where
        mistakes are seen as learning opportunities and not failures. Each debriefing is a key moment to analyze what
        worked and what needs to be improved, based on tangible results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card m-5">
      <h4 class="card-header">
        Difficulty
      </h4>
      <p class="card-body">
        Our approach is to continually improve ourselves to overcome the challenges we encounter, rather than seeking to
        simplify or circumvent them with easy solutions. Every obstacle is an opportunity to refine our skills, our
        procedures, and our team cohesion. This is how we intend to build a high-performing and valued team.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead m-5">
      By adopting these principles, we cultivate an environment where synergy and team spirit allow us to carry out
      complex and rewarding projects together.
